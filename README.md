### 🌱 My story (short version)

I started by being curious.  
That curiosity pulled me into **machine learning**, then into **AI**, and now into **building products**.

Along the way, I realized something important:

> I don’t enjoy just learning things.(I was in a loop for years) 
> I enjoy **bringing ideas to life** and putting them in front of people.

I learn by doing.  
I build, break, rethink, and build again.

### 🧠 What I care about

- Building useful products, not just demos  
- AI & automation as leverage, not hype  
- Mental peace over fake hustle  
- Long-term thinking over quick wins  
- Sharing what I learn, honestly and publicly  

---

### 🚀 What I’m doing now

- Founder of **DeleMate** (peer-to-peer delivery)
- Exploring **AI, LLMs, and agents** through real use cases
- Writing, thinking, and shipping consistently
- Turning random ideas into working products

### ⚡ One honest fact

I don’t have everything figured out.  
But I’m consistent, curious, and willing to try — and that’s enough to keep going.
